# ChatWave Project Overview

## What You've Built

Congratulations! You've successfully created a **real-time chat application** using Java sockets with the following impressive features:

### 🏗️ **Architecture**
- **Multi-threaded server** handling multiple concurrent clients
- **Object-oriented design** with proper separation of concerns
- **Client-server architecture** using TCP sockets
- **Thread-safe operations** using concurrent data structures

### 🎯 **Core Features**
- ✅ **Real-time messaging** between multiple users
- ✅ **Unique usernames** with collision detection
- ✅ **Timestamps** on all messages
- ✅ **GUI interface** using Java Swing
- ✅ **Console interface** for text-based interaction
- ✅ **File sharing** with size limits and safe storage
- ✅ **Command system** (/users, /help, /leave)
- ✅ **Automatic reconnection** handling

### 🛠️ **Technical Skills Demonstrated**

1. **Socket Programming**
   - ServerSocket for listening
   - Socket connections for communication
   - Input/Output streams for data transfer

2. **Multithreading**

   - Thread-safe collections

3. **GUI Development**
   - Swing components and layouts
   - Event handling
   - User experience design

4. **File I/O Operations**
   - File reading and writing
   - Binary data handling
   - Directory management

5. **Object Serialization**
   - Custom Message class
   - Network data transmission
   - Protocol design

6. **Error Handling**
   - Connection management
   - Exception handling
   - Graceful disconnection
